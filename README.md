# How-Perceptions-of-Mental-Health-Have-Changed-on-Social-Media

Mental health has been a growing issue of concern in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. We examine Twitter data using topic modeling and sentiment analysis to determine public perceptions of mental health issues over a seven year time span. Our findings show that the sentiment around mental health has remained positive, but has decreased since the beginning of the pandemic. Major events, such as elections and the pandemic, greatly impact the conversation surrounding mental health. Some topics have remained consistent throughout the seven years. Other topics may have remained consistent, but the way the public discusses these topics has shifted. Twitter data is a useful tool for determining the publicâ€™s perception of trending topics.
